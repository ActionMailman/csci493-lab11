As a simple patch against the insertion of HTML, the new sanitization function removes all ankle brackets from user inputs.
However, this is likely not enough, as regex in general is built to filter natural language and likely will not hold up against more sophisticated XSS attacks.
It would be preferable to use a proper and standards-compliant filter library such as HTML Purifier.
For now, however, this is more secure than the previous sanitization functions.
